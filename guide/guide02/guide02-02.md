# MulmoCast: Direct Video Generation Using Only a Movie Prompt

This manual demonstrates a streamlined workflow for generating a video and its base image in a single step by using only the **Movie Prompt**. This method is ideal when you have a clear idea of both the scene's appearance and its desired animation.

## 1. Adding a New Scene (Beat)

First, add a new beat to your project to create a new scene.

1.  **00:00** In the "Create Video Story" editor, scroll down past your existing beats.
2.  **00:09** Click the **Insert** button located below the last beat.
3.  **00:11** A new, empty beat (e.g., "Beat 2") will be added to your story.

## 2. (Optional) Switching to Advanced Mode

The video demonstrates switching to Advanced Mode, which changes the user interface layout.

1.  **00:22** Click the **Settings** icon in the top-right corner of the application.
2.  **00:24** In the Settings menu, find the **Mode settings** dropdown.
3.  **00:25** Change the mode from "Beginner" to **Advanced**.
4.  **00:26** Close the Settings menu. The interface will now show a three-column layout with "Story Creation with AI Chat," "Create Video Story," and "Output Settings & Generation" panels.

> **Note:** This UI change does not alter the core functionality described below, but it is included here as it occurs in the video.

## 3. Generating a Video with a Single Prompt

This process uses the **Movie Prompt** to generate both the static image and the animated video simultaneously.

1.  **00:30** Navigate to your new, empty beat ("Beat 2").
2.  **00:32** **Important:** Leave the **Image Generation Prompt** field completely empty. This is the key to triggering the one-step generation process.
3.  **00:41** In the **Movie Prompt** field, enter a detailed description that includes both the visual elements of the scene and the desired action. For example: `A blue whale slowly rises toward the surface, sunlight beams shimmer through the water, cinematic lighting.`
4.  **00:43** Click the magic wand icon next to the **Movie Prompt** to start the generation. The status will show "Generating Movie...".
5.  **01:41** The system will automatically create a base image that matches your prompt and then animate it according to the action you described. An "Image generated successfully" notification will appear, and both the image and the video will populate the preview areas.
6.  **01:46** Click on the generated video to open the preview player. Here, you can watch the animation (**01:47**) and download the final MP4 file.

## Key Points & Troubleshooting

*   **One-Step Creation**: By leaving the **Image Generation Prompt** blank, you instruct MulmoCast to use the **Movie Prompt** as the source for creating both the image and the video. This is a highly efficient workflow.
*   **Descriptive Movie Prompts**: For this method to work effectively, your **Movie Prompt** must be descriptive enough to create a compelling visual scene in addition to directing the animation.
*   **"Image Generation Prompt" Must Be Empty**: If you enter text into both the image and movie prompts, the system will revert to the two-step process (generating the image first, then the video). This single-step method only works when the image prompt is empty.
