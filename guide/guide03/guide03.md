# MulmoCast: Using Style Templates for Consistent Character Generation

This guide explains how to use Style Templates to automatically configure character settings, ensuring a consistent character appearance across your project.

## 1. Applying a Style Template

Style templates allow you to quickly load a full set of pre-defined settings, including character designs, voice styles, and image parameters.

1.  (00:02) From the Dashboard, click **+ Create New** to start a new project.
2.  (00:06) Navigate to the **Style** tab in the "Create Video Story" editor.
3.  **00:10** In the **Style template** section, click the dropdown menu ("Please select a style").
4.  **00:12** Choose a pre-configured style from the list. In this example, **Presentation by Ani** is selected.
5.  **00:13** Click the **Apply Style** button to load the template's settings.
6.  **00:15** A "Script created successfully" notification will appear. You will see that various fields, such as **Reading Style** and the **Style** field in Image Parameters, have been automatically populated.

## 2. Reviewing the Automatic Character Setup

Applying a style template also sets up the associated character, which can be verified in the Character tab.

1.  (00:31) Click the **Character** tab.
2.  **00:32** You will see that the Style Template has automatically created a character entry. Here, the character "ani" is listed with its reference image already loaded. This ensures that the AI will use this specific character design for all future image generations in the project.

## 3. Generating a Scene with the Pre-set Character

Once the style and character are set, you can generate an image with a very simple prompt. The system will automatically use the character you configured.

1.  (00:34) Return to the **BEAT** tab.
2.  **00:35** Notice that in the **Character Image** section, the character from your style template ("ani") is already selected.
3.  (00:43) Enter your script or narration text in the main input field (e.g., "Now, let's talk about Character Setting...").
4.  **00:45** In the **Image Generation Prompt** field, provide only a simple description of the background or setting. You do not need to describe the character. For this example, the prompt is simply `"in the forest."`
5.  (00:55) Click the magic wand icon to begin generating the image.
6.  **02:31** The generated image appears in the preview box. It correctly places the pre-defined "ani" character into the forest background described in the prompt.

## Key Points & Troubleshooting

*   **Automatic Setup**: Style Templates are a powerful shortcut that can configure dozens of settings at once, including loading specific, consistent characters.
*   **Character Consistency**: Using the **Character** feature (which is automated by the style template) is the best way to maintain the same character appearance across multiple scenes.
*   **Minimal Prompts Needed**: When a character is pre-selected for a beat, you only need to describe the background, action, or environment in the **Image Generation Prompt**. The AI will automatically add the selected character to the scene.
*   **Troubleshooting**: If your character does not appear in the generated image, return to the **BEAT** tab and confirm that the correct character is checked in the **Character Image** box.
